# üåø Git Branches - Learning Guide

This project uses Git branches to organize the learning material. Each branch represents a specific learning module or concept.

## üìö Branch Structure

### Learning Branches (In Order)

```
main
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-setup-and-configuration
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-prisma-service-module
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-one-to-one-users-profiles
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04-one-to-many-and-many-to-many-posts
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05-categories-many-to-many
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 06-comments-multiple-foreign-keys
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07-app-integration-and-seed
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 08-documentation-and-guides
```

## üéØ How to Use These Branches

### Option 1: View All at Once (Recommended for Quick Start)

Stay on `main` branch - it has everything merged:

```bash
# You're already here!
git checkout main
```

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Learning (Recommended for Deep Learning)

Checkout each branch in order to see the progressive development:

```bash
# Branch 1: Setup
git checkout 01-setup-and-configuration
# Study: docker-compose.yml, prisma/schema.prisma, package.json

# Branch 2: Prisma Integration
git checkout 02-prisma-service-module
# Study: src/prisma/

# Branch 3: ONE-TO-ONE
git checkout 03-one-to-one-users-profiles
# Study: src/users/

# Branch 4: ONE-TO-MANY & MANY-TO-MANY
git checkout 04-one-to-many-and-many-to-many-posts
# Study: src/posts/

# Branch 5: MANY-TO-MANY (Inverse)
git checkout 05-categories-many-to-many
# Study: src/categories/

# Branch 6: Multiple Relationships
git checkout 06-comments-multiple-foreign-keys
# Study: src/comments/

# Branch 7: Integration
git checkout 07-app-integration-and-seed
# Study: src/app.module.ts, prisma/seed.ts

# Branch 8: Documentation
git checkout 08-documentation-and-guides
# Study: All .md files

# Back to main
git checkout main
```

### Option 3: Compare Changes

See what each branch added:

```bash
# What was added in setup branch?
git diff main 01-setup-and-configuration

# What's different in users module?
git diff 02-prisma-service-module 03-one-to-one-users-profiles

# See all changes with file names
git diff --name-status 01-setup-and-configuration 02-prisma-service-module
```

### Option 4: View Specific Files from Branches

Look at files without switching branches:

```bash
# View users service from its branch
git show 03-one-to-one-users-profiles:src/users/users.service.ts

# View schema from setup branch
git show 01-setup-and-configuration:prisma/schema.prisma
```

## üí° Tips for Using Branches

### 1. Keep Main Safe

```bash
# Always work on a new branch
git checkout -b my-experiments
# Experiment freely without affecting main
```

### 2. Compare Your Changes

```bash
# See what you changed
git diff main

# See what files changed
git status
```

### 3. Reset If Needed

```bash
# Discard all local changes
git checkout .

# Reset to branch state
git reset --hard
```

### 4. Search Across Branches

```bash
# Find where something is defined
git grep "createWithProfile" $(git rev-list --all)

# Search in specific branch
git grep "ONE-TO-ONE" 03-one-to-one-users-profiles
```

### 5. View History

```bash
# See all commits
git log --oneline --graph --all

# See commits in a branch
git log 03-one-to-one-users-profiles

# See what a commit did
git show <commit-hash>
```
