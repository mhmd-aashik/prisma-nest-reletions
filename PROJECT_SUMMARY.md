# 📊 Project Summary - Prisma ORM Learning with NestJS

## 🎉 Project Complete!

This project provides a complete, production-ready example of using Prisma ORM with NestJS to demonstrate all types of database relationships.

---

## 📦 What's Included

### 🗄️ Database Models

- **User** - Main user entity
- **Profile** - User profile (ONE-TO-ONE with User)
- **Post** - Blog posts (ONE-TO-MANY with User, MANY-TO-MANY with Categories)
- **Category** - Post categories (MANY-TO-MANY with Posts)
- **Comment** - Post comments (ONE-TO-MANY with Posts and Users)
- **PostCategory** - Explicit join table for MANY-TO-MANY

### 🔗 Relationship Types Covered

#### 1. ONE-TO-ONE

- **User ↔ Profile**
- Each user has one optional profile
- Profile belongs to exactly one user
- Demonstrates: `@unique`, optional relationships, nested creates, cascade delete

#### 2. ONE-TO-MANY

- **User → Posts** (A user can write many posts)
- **User → Comments** (A user can write many comments)
- **Post → Comments** (A post can have many comments)
- Demonstrates: Arrays in schema, foreign keys, filtering, counting

#### 3. MANY-TO-MANY

- **Posts ↔ Categories**
- Explicit join table (PostCategory) with additional fields
- Demonstrates: Join tables, connect operations, querying through relationships
